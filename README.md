# Morningside Beacon

Beacon is a tool for creating delightful knowledge graphs for researchers.

### Principles

* **"It's Just Text."** There are no databases, no binary formats. Your knowledge is always under your control and never behind any layers.

* **Blazing Fast Retrieval** What's the use in storing knowledge that you can never sift through? Full text search and light-speed queries mean your knowledge is always at your fingertips.

* **Excellent at one thing** Your favorite editor already exists. Your favorite version control system already exists. Beacon is an excellent document manager and that's all it wants to be.
 
* **Plays Well With others** Beacon's is extensible. Beacon wants to output your
  database to Markdown in as many ways as possible. Output the result of your
  query as a standalone Markdown document -- nice thesis you got there. Or
  perhaps link-connected documents for fast conversion to a static site. However
  you slice it, Beacon will export it.
